The main website is https://www.bitmonky.com/
This website has a lot of features with different functionality which are all located on the main page. this could be a bit confusing to remember all things.
In order to organize this issue I would like to seperate them in small isolated sections to manage them better.

We can have a header with a reasonable navbar to guide users where they really want to go.
